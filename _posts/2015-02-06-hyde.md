title: Introducing Hyde and my github.io blog

Well I've been meaning to make a minimalist blog for some time now. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a brilliant static page generator that gulps down markdown files to generate html content. PS: This blog is obviously written in markdown.

I saw the original post on this [post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) which is quite terrific. However the theme of the blog wasn't very impressive. So I used the jekyll theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com).

### Begin
Head over to [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and fork their repo. Goto settings and change the repo name to username.github.io and voila the website is hosted at username.github.io.
