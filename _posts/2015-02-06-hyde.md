Well I've been meaning to make a minimalist blog for some time now. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a brilliant static page generator that gulps up markdown files to generate html content. This blog is obviously written in markdown.

I saw the original post on this [post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) which is quite terrific. However the theme of the blog wasn't very impressive.
