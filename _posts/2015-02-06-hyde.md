Well I've been meaning to make a minimalist blog for some time now. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a brilliant static page generator that gulps down markdown files to generate html content. This blog is obviously written in markdown.

I saw the original post on this [post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) which is quite terrific. However the theme of the blog wasn't very impressive. So I used the jekyll theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com).

### Init Blog
Head over to [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and fork their repo. Goto settings and change the repo name to username.github.io and voila the website is hosted at username.github.io. This is really neat since it saves me ~$50 annually.

### Domain Name
Next I bought a domain at [namecheap.com](http://www.namecheap.com). They were the cheapest at the time, about $9/year. After purchasing the domain all I had to do was point it to username.github.io. IP forwarding can be done but that is slow and defeats the purpose of purchasing the domain.

* In the root directory of the github repo add a file with name CNAME (no extension). Only add the one line - **www.yourdomainname.com** to the file. Make sure this is exactly the same domain and sub-domain with which you want to access the blog.
* In your namecheap account, goto **Access All Records**, and to the **www** hostname, add the CNAME record username.github.io. To the **@** hostname add the ANAME record **199.27.79.133**. The @ hostname takes some time to work. @ is the website without the www sub-domain.
* To verify, in the terminal try `dig yourdomainname.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd` and `dig www.yourdomainname.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd`. The www host should point to something like github.map.fastly.net and the @ host to the ip.

I next added Disqus comments, hooked up google analytics and an archive page all of which can be found at [this](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) blog.
