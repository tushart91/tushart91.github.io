title: My interview with Bloomberg, New York

###Background
I plan to do an internship this summer. However, I've been turned down by nuuuuumerous companies. Partly because I've been a lazy bum and haven't really studied anything. The idea of preparing for an interview is total bullshit. An interview should be based on stuff you've done. Not what you've read up in the past few days. Unfortunately tech interviews ***suck*** major ass. Seeing all my roomates score awesome internships I guess I too sucked up to [*Cracking the Coding Interview*](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X). The result - I scored an internship with Bloomberg in f&%king New York. Goes to show lazy people get things done as and when needed. Thumbs up if your lazy :+1:.

###Interview
The interview process was easier than I expected and yes that f&%king book was crazy effective. On the telephonic interview I was asked:

* Given a file containing words. Find all anagrams. Easy-peasy hash-table.
* Find the fastest way to sum up the digits of a number until a single digit is left. It's called a digital sum. This was kinda difficult but the interviewer helped me out. [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2686915/1442749)

I was called for the onsite interview in ***f&%king Manhattan***. The view from their office was insanely cool. On the 23rd floor, overlooking Manhattan. However the interviews were quite easy. The questions were:

* Find the intersection in two linked lists.
* Implement the atoi function with all its test cases.
* In a graph find all the nodes effected by a given node. I was like seriously, isn't there something difficult than this.
* Given a program that writes 10KB of data to a file, sleeps then forks. How much time for the file to become 10MB.
* How would you go about implementing a vector. There was some back and forth arguments. Overall I shut the interviewer up pretty good.

Then, I had a one on one with a manager. We spoke about my previous experience. Then I proceeded to a one on one with someone in HR.
Overall it was an awesome experience. My biggest take from the trip was how awesome New York is. It is definitely not over-rated. ***New York FTW!!!***
