###Experience

####**eBay Inc.:** Software Engineer, DevX

Worked on enhancing the Integrated Connections Management (ICM) tool that manages approvals and
package information for releasing packaged code into live.

* Modified the heirarchy between environments to force user to deploy only to low level environments
before the high level environments and not vice-versa. Superior flexibility to the user and reduction in
abandoned packages. Reduced ~5% of support tickets that required manual data manipulation.
* Added lookup for ip-address, server-farm for packages. Manually searched and entered before by ops.
* Added form validation (bounds) for input elements used by architects. Avoided inconsistent data.
* Team featured in annual newsletter (2013-14) for huge reduction (days to 0-4 hours) in deploy time.

####**eBay Inc.** SDE Intern, Platform Engineering, Dr. Murali Nandigama Jan - Jun 2013
* Combined historical and real-time data of compute intensive processes, and the most repeating patterns
are found and is used to set higher processor affinity for these processes by creating a wrapper.
* The processes’ metrics are stored by using a hook to nagios that stores a snapshot of the running processes
in the databases when CPU usage is high.
* Reported directly to our Director of Engineering.
